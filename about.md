Hi, I'm Ada. I'm a developer based in Singapore. I primarily dabble in machine learning, but have experience in web development, cybersecurity, competitive programming, cloud stuff, and some physics and math.

I've also played 2000 hours of Team Fortress 2. If you're a regular in the Asia Pacific region, we've probably shared a server at some point.

I'm currently awaiting matriculation at the National University of Singapore. If you study here too, come say hi!
